## About the Project

### Overview

MathIntuit is an interactive, web-based learning platform designed to help users grasp fundamental and advanced mathematical concepts intuitively through interactive visualizations. The platform simplifies complex mathematical topics by making them more approachable and easy to explore in a hands-on way.

Users can explore various mathematical concepts, such as calculus, algebra, geometry, and more, through dynamic, real-time visual aids and step-by-step explanations.

### Demo
