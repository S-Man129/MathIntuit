    <h1>Power Series of Sine and Cosine</h1>
    <p>
      The power series for the sine and cosine functions are among the most
      fundamental tools in calculus and mathematical analysis. These series
      expansions allow us to express trigonometric functions as infinite sums of
      polynomial terms. This is particularly useful for approximating these
      functions, solving differential equations, and in various applications
      across physics, engineering, and other fields of science.
    </p>

    <h2>What is a Power Series?</h2>
    <p>A power series is an infinite series of the form:</p>
    <div class="formula">
      \[ f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^n = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + a_3x^3 +
      \cdots \]
    </div>
    <p>
      where \( a_n \) represents the coefficients of the series, and \( x \) is
      the variable. Power series can represent a wide variety of functions
      within a certain interval of convergence.
    </p>

    <h2>Power Series of the Sine Function</h2>
    <p>
      The sine function can be expressed as a power series using its Taylor
      series expansion around \( x = 0 \) (Maclaurin series):
    </p>
    <div class="formula">
      \[ \sin(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1)!} x^{2n+1} \]
    </div>
    <p>
      This series alternates in sign, and only odd powers of \( x \) appear in
      the expansion. The general term is:
    </p>
    <div class="formula">\[ \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1)!} x^{2n+1} \]</div>

    <div class="box-container text-center mb-4">
      <div id="powerSeriesSine" class="box">
        <script src="./js/powerSeriesSine.js"></script>
      </div>
      <p>Visualizing the Power Series of Sine</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Expanded Form:</h3>
    <div class="formula">
      \[ \sin(x) = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \frac{x^7}{7!} + \cdots
      \]
    </div>
    <p>Where:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>\( x^3/3! \) is the third-degree term, with \( 3! = 6 \).</li>
      <li>\( x^5/5! \) is the fifth-degree term, with \( 5! = 120 \).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Convergence:</h3>
    <p>
      The sine power series converges for all real values of \( x \). However,
      the convergence is faster for values of \( x \) near zero, making the
      series particularly useful for small angles.
    </p>

    <h3>Example: Approximating \(\sin(x)\)</h3>
    <p>To approximate \(\sin(0.5)\) using the first few terms of the series:</p>
    <div class="formula">
      \[ \sin(0.5) \approx 0.5 - \frac{0.5^3}{6} + \frac{0.5^5}{120} \] \[
      \sin(0.5) \approx 0.5 - 0.0208333 + 0.0002604 \] \[ \sin(0.5) \approx
      0.4794271 \]
    </div>
    <p>
      This approximation is very close to the actual value of \( \sin(0.5) \),
      which is about 0.4794255.
    </p>

    <h2>Power Series of the Cosine Function</h2>
    <p>
      The cosine function also has a power series representation, derived from
      its Taylor series expansion around \( x = 0 \):
    </p>
    <div class="formula">
      \[ \cos(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n)!} x^{2n} \]
    </div>
    <p>
      This series, like that of the sine, alternates in sign, but it includes
      only even powers of \( x \). The general term is:
    </p>
    <div class="formula">\[ \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n)!} x^{2n} \]</div>

    <div class="box-container text-center mb-4">
      <div id="powerSeriesCosine" class="box">
        <script src="./js/powerSeriesCosine.js"></script>
      </div>
      <p>Visualizing the Power Series of Cosine</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Expanded Form:</h3>
    <div class="formula">
      \[ \cos(x) = 1 - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} - \frac{x^6}{6!} + \cdots
      \]
    </div>
    <p>Where:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>\( x^2/2! \) is the second-degree term, with \( 2! = 2 \).</li>
      <li>\( x^4/4! \) is the fourth-degree term, with \( 4! = 24 \).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Convergence:</h3>
    <p>
      The cosine power series converges for all real values of \( x \). Similar
      to the sine series, the convergence is faster near \( x = 0 \), making it
      effective for small angles.
    </p>

    <h3>Example: Approximating \(\cos(x)\)</h3>
    <p>To approximate \(\cos(0.5)\) using the first few terms of the series:</p>
    <div class="formula">
      \[ \cos(0.5) \approx 1 - \frac{0.5^2}{2} + \frac{0.5^4}{24} \] \[
      \cos(0.5) \approx 1 - 0.125 + 0.0026042 \] \[ \cos(0.5) \approx 0.8776042
      \]
    </div>
    <p>
      This is close to the actual value of \( \cos(0.5) \), which is about
      0.8775826.
    </p>

    <h2>Applications of Sine and Cosine Power Series</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Approximations in Physics and Engineering:</strong>
        <p>
          Small-angle approximations, where \( \sin(x) \approx x \) and \(
          \cos(x) \approx 1 - \frac{x^2}{2} \), are derived directly from the
          first few terms of these power series. These approximations are
          essential in fields like classical mechanics, optics, and electrical
          engineering.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Signal Processing:</strong>
        <p>
          The Fourier series, which decomposes periodic functions into sums of
          sines and cosines, relies heavily on the understanding of sine and
          cosine series. This is foundational in signal processing, where
          signals are analyzed and manipulated.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Solving Differential Equations:</strong>
        <p>
          Many solutions to linear differential equations, particularly those
          involving periodic phenomena, are expressed in terms of sine and
          cosine series. This is crucial in studying wave equations, heat
          equations, and other phenomena in physics.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Computation:</strong>
        <p>
          In numerical computation, functions like sine and cosine are often
          computed using their power series expansions. This is because these
          expansions can be truncated to provide sufficiently accurate results,
          especially for small angles or within a limited range of \( x \).
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Visualization and Understanding</h2>
    <p>
      Visualizing these series expansions can be enlightening. By plotting the
      sine and cosine functions alongside their power series approximations
      (truncated to different numbers of terms), one can see how the
      approximation improves as more terms are included. For small values of \(
      x \), the truncated series closely matches the actual function, but for
      larger \( x \), more terms are needed to achieve the same accuracy.
    </p>

    <h2>Historical Context</h2>
    <p>
      The development of the power series for sine and cosine functions is
      deeply rooted in the history of calculus. Isaac Newton and James Gregory
      were among the early mathematicians to explore series expansions of
      trigonometric functions. These expansions played a critical role in the
      development of calculus and the analysis of functions, laying the
      groundwork for much of modern mathematical analysis.
    </p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      The power series for sine and cosine are powerful tools in mathematics.
      These series allow us to express these fundamental trigonometric functions
      as infinite polynomials, providing deep insights into their behavior and
      enabling numerous practical applications. Whether approximating values for
      small angles or solving complex differential equations, the power series
      for sine and cosine are indispensable in both theory and practice.
