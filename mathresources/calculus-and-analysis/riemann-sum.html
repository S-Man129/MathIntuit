    <h1>Riemann Sum</h1>
    <p>
      The Riemann sum is a fundamental concept in calculus, used to approximate
      the area under a curve or, more generally, the integral of a function over
      an interval. Named after the German mathematician Bernhard Riemann, the
      Riemann sum forms the basis for defining the definite integral and is
      crucial in understanding how calculus connects discrete approximations
      with continuous phenomena.
    </p>

    <h2>Understanding the Riemann Sum</h2>
    <p>
      Imagine you want to find the area under a curve, say \( f(x) \), over a
      certain interval \([a, b]\). If the curve is simple, like a straight line,
      you can calculate the area using basic geometry. However, if the curve is
      irregular, finding the exact area becomes more challenging. The Riemann
      sum provides a method to approximate this area by dividing the interval
      into smaller subintervals, calculating the area of simple shapes (usually
      rectangles) over each subinterval, and summing these areas.
    </p>

    <h2>The Concept</h2>
    <p>
      The idea behind the Riemann sum is to break down a complicated shape into
      smaller, more manageable pieces. Here's how it works:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Divide the Interval:</strong> Divide the interval \([a, b]\)
        into \( n \) subintervals of equal width \( \Delta x = \frac{b - a}{n}
        \).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Choose Sample Points:</strong> In each subinterval, choose a
        sample point \( x_i^* \). The sample point can be chosen in several
        ways, leading to different types of Riemann sums. The most common
        methods are:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Left Riemann Sum:</strong> The sample point is the left
            endpoint of each subinterval.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Right Riemann Sum:</strong> The sample point is the right
            endpoint of each subinterval.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Midpoint Riemann Sum:</strong> The sample point is the
            midpoint of each subinterval.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Calculate the Area of Rectangles:</strong> For each subinterval,
        calculate the area of the rectangle formed by the function value at the
        sample point \( f(x_i^*) \) and the width of the subinterval \( \Delta x
        \).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sum the Areas:</strong> Add up the areas of all the rectangles
        to obtain the Riemann sum.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Mathematically, the Riemann sum is expressed as:</p>
    <div class="formula">\[ S_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i^*) \Delta x \]</div>
    <p>Where:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>\( S_n \) is the Riemann sum.</li>
      <li>
        \( f(x_i^*) \) is the function value at the sample point \( x_i^* \) in
        the \( i \)th subinterval.
      </li>
      <li>\( \Delta x \) is the width of each subinterval.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As the number of subintervals \( n \) increases (i.e., \( \Delta x \)
      becomes smaller), the Riemann sum becomes a more accurate approximation of
      the area under the curve. In the limit as \( n \) approaches infinity, the
      Riemann sum converges to the exact value of the definite integral of \(
      f(x) \) over \([a, b]\):
    </p>
    <div class="formula">
      \[ \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i^*)
      \Delta x \]
    </div>

    <h2>Types of Riemann Sums</h2>
    <p>
      There are several types of Riemann sums, each depending on how the sample
      points \( x_i^* \) are chosen within the subintervals:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Left Riemann Sum:</strong>
        <div class="formula">
          \[ S_n^{\text{left}} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} f(x_i) \Delta x \]
        </div>
        <p>
          Here, \( x_i \) is the left endpoint of each subinterval. This method
          may underestimate or overestimate the area, depending on whether the
          function is increasing or decreasing.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Right Riemann Sum:</strong>
        <div class="formula">
          \[ S_n^{\text{right}} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i) \Delta x \]
        </div>
        <p>
          In this case, \( x_i \) is the right endpoint of each subinterval.
          Like the left Riemann sum, this method can also lead to
          underestimation or overestimation.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Midpoint Riemann Sum:</strong>
        <div class="formula">
          \[ S_n^{\text{mid}} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} f\left(\frac{x_{i-1} +
          x_i}{2}\right) \Delta x \]
        </div>
        <p>
          Here, the sample point is the midpoint of each subinterval. The
          midpoint Riemann sum often provides a better approximation than the
          left or right Riemann sum because it balances the overestimation and
          underestimation.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Trapezoidal Sum (Trapezoidal Rule):</strong>
        <p>
          While not strictly a Riemann sum, the trapezoidal sum is a related
          method that uses trapezoids instead of rectangles to approximate the
          area:
        </p>
        <div class="formula">
          \[ S_n^{\text{trap}} = \frac{\Delta x}{2} \left[ f(x_0) +
          2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} f(x_i) + f(x_n) \right] \]
        </div>
        <p>
          This method averages the left and right Riemann sums and generally
          provides a better approximation.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <h3>Example 1: Left Riemann Sum</h3>
    <p>
      Consider the function \( f(x) = x^2 \) on the interval \([0, 2]\). Divide
      the interval into four subintervals and use the left Riemann sum to
      approximate the area under the curve.
    </p>
    <h4>1. Divide the Interval:</h4>
    <p>
      \( [0, 2] \) is divided into four subintervals: \( [0, 0.5], [0.5, 1], [1,
      1.5], [1.5, 2] \).
    </p>
    <h4>2. Sample Points:</h4>
    <p>The left endpoints are \( 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5 \).</p>
    <h4>3. Calculate the Areas:</h4>
    <div class="formula">
      \[ S_4^{\text{left}} = f(0) \cdot 0.5 + f(0.5) \cdot 0.5 + f(1) \cdot 0.5
      + f(1.5) \cdot 0.5 \] \[ = 0 \cdot 0.5 + 0.25 \cdot 0.5 + 1 \cdot 0.5 +
      2.25 \cdot 0.5 = 0 + 0.125 + 0.5 + 1.125 = 1.75 \]
    </div>
    <p>So, the left Riemann sum gives an approximate area of 1.75.</p>

    <h3>Example 2: Midpoint Riemann Sum</h3>
    <p>
      Using the same function \( f(x) = x^2 \) on the interval \([0, 2]\),
      calculate the midpoint Riemann sum with four subintervals.
    </p>
    <h4>1. Divide the Interval:</h4>
    <p>The same subintervals: \( [0, 0.5], [0.5, 1], [1, 1.5], [1.5, 2] \).</p>
    <h4>2. Sample Points:</h4>
    <p>The midpoints are \( 0.25, 0.75, 1.25, 1.75 \).</p>
    <h4>3. Calculate the Areas:</h4>
    <div class="formula">
      \[ S_4^{\text{mid}} = f(0.25) \cdot 0.5 + f(0.75) \cdot 0.5 + f(1.25)
      \cdot 0.5 + f(1.75) \cdot 0.5 \] \[ = 0.0625 \cdot 0.5 + 0.5625 \cdot 0.5
      + 1.5625 \cdot 0.5 + 3.0625 \cdot 0.5 = 0.03125 + 0.28125 + 0.78125 +
      1.53125 = 2.625 \]
    </div>
    <p>
      The midpoint Riemann sum gives a better approximation of the area, 2.625.
    </p>

    <h2>Applications of Riemann Sums</h2>
    <p>
      Riemann sums are not just theoretical tools; they have practical
      applications in many fields:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Physics:</strong>
        <p>
          In physics, Riemann sums are used to approximate quantities like work,
          energy, and electric charge, where the quantities are distributed over
          a region and can be represented as integrals.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Economics:</strong>
        <p>
          In economics, Riemann sums can approximate total costs, revenues, or
          other economic indicators over a continuous range of prices or
          quantities.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Engineering:</strong>
        <p>
          Engineers use Riemann sums to approximate the area under curves that
          represent stress, strain, or other variables in materials and
          structures.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Computer Science:</strong>
        <p>
          In computer science, algorithms that involve summation or integration
          over continuous data often use Riemann sums for approximation,
          particularly in numerical methods.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Historical Context</h2>
    <p>
      The concept of the Riemann sum was introduced by Bernhard Riemann in the
      19th century as part of his broader work on integration theory. Riemann's
      approach was revolutionary because it provided a rigorous foundation for
      the concept of the integral, which was previously defined more intuitively
      by earlier mathematicians like Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.
    </p>

    <h2>Limitations and Extensions</h2>
    <p>While Riemann sums are powerful, they have limitations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Dependence on the Partition:</strong> The accuracy of a Riemann
        sum depends on how the interval is partitioned. Unequal partitions or
        poor choice of sample points can lead to less accurate approximations.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Integrability:</strong> Not all functions are Riemann
        integrable. Functions that are too "wild" or have too many
        discontinuities may not be accurately approximated by Riemann sums.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Extensions of the Riemann sum concept include the
      <strong>Lebesgue integral</strong>, which generalizes integration to a
      broader class of functions and measures.
    </p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      The Riemann sum is a foundational concept in calculus, offering a method
      to approximate the area under a curve and laying the groundwork for the
      definite integral. Whether applied in physics, economics, or engineering,
      Riemann sums help bridge the gap between discrete approximations and
      continuous processes. Understanding Riemann sums is essential for anyone
      studying calculus, as they provide the stepping stones toward more
      advanced mathematical concepts and applications.
