        Fourier transforms are a tool used in a whole bunch of different things.
        This is an explanation of what a Fourier transform does, and some
        different ways it can be useful. And how you can make pretty things with
        it, like this thing:

        I'm going to explain how that animation works, and along the way explain
        Fourier transforms!

        <li>What a Fourier transform does</li>

        <li>Some pointless but cool uses of Fourier transforms</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We're going to leave the mathematics and equations out of it for now.
        There's a bunch of interesting maths behind it, but it's better to start
        with what it actually does, and why you'd want to use it first. If you
        want to know more about the how, there's some further reading
        suggestions below!
      </p>
      <h2 id="sowhatisthisthing">So what is this thing?</h2>
      <p>
        Put simply, the Fourier transform is a way of splitting something up
        into a bunch of sine waves. As usual, the name comes from some person
        who lived a long time ago called Fourier.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let’s start with some simple examples and work our way up. First up
        we're going to look at waves - patterns that repeat over time.
      </p>
      <p>Here’s an example wave:</p>
      <canvas
        id="combo-sine-wave"
        class="sketch"
        width="500"
        height="300"
      ></canvas>
      <p>
        This wavy pattern here can be split up into sine waves. That is, when we
        add up the two sine waves we get back the original wave.
      </p>
      <canvas
        id="combo-sine-wave-split"
        class="sketch"
        width="500"
        height="500"
      ></canvas>
      <p>
        The Fourier transform is a way for us to take the combined wave, and get
        each of the sine waves back out. In this example, you can almost do it
        in your head, just by looking at the original wave.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why? Turns out a lot of things in the real world interact based on these
        sine waves. We usually call them the wave's frequencies.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most obvious example is sound – when we hear a sound, we don’t hear
        that squiggly line, but we hear the different frequencies of the sine
        waves that make up the sound.
      </p>
      <p><button id="together-button" class="button">Play Full Wave</button></p>
      <p>
        <button id="split-button-1" class="button">Play High Frequency</button>
      </p>
      <p>
        <button id="split-button-2" class="button">Play Low Frequency</button>
      </p>
      <p>
        Being able to split them up on a computer can give us an understanding
        of what a person actually hears. We can understand how high or low a
        sound is, or figure out what note it is.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can also use this process on waves that don't look like they're made
        of sine waves.
      </p>
      <p>Let's take a look at this guy. It’s called a square wave.</p>
      <canvas id="square-wave" class="sketch" width="500" height="300"></canvas>
      <p>
        It might not look like it, but it also can be split up into sine waves.
      </p>
      <canvas
        id="square-wave-split"
        class="sketch"
        width="500"
        height="500"
      ></canvas>
      <p>
        We need a lot of them this time – technically an infinite amount to
        perfectly represent it. As we add up more and more sine waves the
        pattern gets closer and closer to the square wave we started with.
      </p>
      <canvas
        id="square-wave-build-up"
        class="sketch"
        width="500"
        height="500"
      ></canvas>
      <p>
        <input
          id="square-wave-build-up-slider"
          type="range"
          min="0"
          max="1"
          value="0"
          step="any"
        />
      </p>
      <p><button id="square-wave-button" class="button">Play Wave</button></p>
      <p>
        <em
          >Drag the slider above to play with how many sine waves there are.</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Visually, you'll notice that actually the first few sine waves are the
        ones that make the biggest difference. With the slider halfway, we have
        the general shape of the wave, but it's all wiggly. We just need the
        rest of the small ones to make the wigglyness flatten out.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you listen to the wave, you'll hear the sound get lower, because
        we're removing the higher frequencies.
      </p>
      <p>
        This process works like that for any repeating line. Give it a go, try
        drawing your own!
      </p>
      <div class="multi-container">
        <div class="sketch">
          <canvas
            id="wave-draw"
            class="sketch-child"
            width="500"
            height="300"
          ></canvas>
          <p id="wave-draw-instruction" class="instruction wave-instruction">
            Draw here!
          </p>
        </div>
        <canvas
          id="wave-draw-split"
          class="sketch"
          width="500"
          height="500"
        ></canvas>
      </div>
      <p>
        <input
          id="wave-draw-slider"
          type="range"
          min="0"
          max="1"
          value="1"
          step="any"
        />
        <button id="wave-draw-button" class="button">Play Wave</button>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em
          >Move the slider to see how as we add more sine waves, it gets closer
          and closer to your drawing</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Again, aside from the extra wigglyness, the wave looks pretty similar
        with just half of the sine waves.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can actually use the fact that the wave is pretty similar to our
        advantage. By using a Fourier transform, we can get the important parts
        of a sound, and only store those to end up with something that's pretty
        close to the original sound.
      </p>
      <p>Normally on a computer we store a wave as a series of points.</p>
      <canvas
        id="wave-samples"
        class="sketch"
        width="500"
        height="500"
      ></canvas>
      <p>
        What we can do instead is represent it as a bunch of sine waves. Then we
        can compress the sound by ignoring the smaller frequencies. Our end
        result won't be the same, but it'll sound pretty similar to a person.
      </p>
      <canvas
        id="wave-frequencies"
        class="sketch"
        width="500"
        height="500"
      ></canvas>
      <p>
        This is essentially what MP3s do, except they're more clever about which
        frequencies they keep and which ones they throw away.
      </p>
      <p>
        So in this case, we can use Fourier transforms to get an understanding
        of the fundamental properties of a wave, and then we can use that for
        things like compression.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ok, now let's dig more into the Fourier transform. This next part looks
        cool, but also gives you a bit more understanding of what the Fourier
        transform does. But mostly looks cool.
      </p>
      <h2 id="epicycles">Epicycles</h2>
      <p>
        Now at the start, I said it splits things into sine waves. The thing is,
        the sine waves it creates are not just regular sine waves, but they’re
        3D. You could call them "complex sinusoids". Or just "spirals".
      </p>
      <canvas
        id="complex-sinusoid"
        class="sketch"
        width="500"
        height="500"
      ></canvas>
      <p>
        If we take a look from the side, they look like sine waves. From front
        on, though, these look like circles.
      </p>
      <canvas
        id="complex-sinusoid-turn"
        class="sketch"
        width="500"
        height="500"
      ></canvas>
      <p>
        So far everything we’ve been doing has only required the regular 2D sine
        waves. When we do a Fourier transform on 2D waves, the complex parts
        cancel out so we just end up with sine waves.
      </p>
      <p>
        But we can use the 3D sine waves to make something fun looking like
        this:
      </p>
      <canvas
        id="peace-epicycles"
        class="sketch"
        width="500"
        height="500"
      ></canvas>
      <p>What’s going on here?</p>
      <p>
        Well, we can think of the drawing as a 3D shape because of the way it
        moves around in time. If you imagine the hand being drawn by a person,
        the three dimensions represent where the tip of their pencil is at that
        moment. The x and y dimensions tell us the position, and then the time
        dimension is the time at that moment.
      </p>
      <canvas id="peace-3d" class="sketch" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
      <p>
        Now that we have a 3D pattern, we can't use the regular 2D sine waves to
        represent it. No matter how many of the 2D sine waves we add up, we'll
        never get something 3D. So we need something else.
      </p>
      <p>
        What we can use is the 3D spiral sine waves from before. If we add up
        lots of those, we can get something that looks like our 3D pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember, these waves look like circles when we look at them from front
        on. The name for the pattern of a circle moving around another circle is
        an epicycle.
      </p>
      <canvas
        id="peace-build-up"
        class="sketch"
        width="500"
        height="500"
      ></canvas>
      <p>
        <input
          id="peace-build-up-slider"
          type="range"
          min="0"
          max="1"
          value="1"
          step="any"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Use the slider above to control how many circles there are.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Like before, we get a pretty good approximation of our pattern with just
        a few circles. Because this is a fairly simple shape, all the last ones
        do is make the edges a little sharper.
      </p>
      <p>
        All this applies to any drawing, really! Now it’s your chance to play
        around with it.
      </p>
      <div class="multi-container">
        <div class="sketch">
          <canvas
            id="draw-zone"
            class="sketch-child"
            width="500"
            height="500"
          ></canvas>
          <p id="draw-zone-instruction" class="instruction">Draw here!</p>
          <button id="draw-zone-undo-button" class="button embedded-button">
            Undo
          </button>
        </div>
        <canvas
          id="circle-zone"
          class="sketch"
          width="500"
          height="500"
        ></canvas>
      </div>
      <p>
        <input
          id="circle-zone-slider"
          type="range"
          min="0"
          max="1"
          value="1"
          step="any"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        <em
          >Use the slider to control how many circles are used for your
          drawing</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Again, you'll see for most shapes, we can approximate them fairly well
        with just a small number of circles, instead of saving all the points.
      </p>
      <p>
        Can we use this for real data? Well, we could! In reality we have
        another data format called SVG, which probably does a better job for the
        types of shapes we tend to create. So for the moment, this is really
        just for making cool little gifs.
      </p>
      <canvas
        id="fourier-title"
        class="sketch"
        width="500"
        height="300"
      ></canvas>
      <p>
        There is another type of visual data that does use Fourier transforms,
        however.
      </p>
      <h2 id="jpegs">JPEGs</h2>
      <p>
        Did you know Fourier transforms can also be used on images? In fact, we
        use it all the time, because that's how JPEGs work! We're applying the
        same principles to images – splitting up something into a bunch of sine
        waves, and then only storing the important ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now we're dealing with images, we need a different type of sine wave. We
        need to have something that no matter what image we have, we can add up
        a bunch of these sine waves to get back to our original image.
      </p>
      <p>
        To do that, each of our sine waves will be images too. Instead of a wave
        that's a line, we now have images with black and white sections. To
        represent the size of a wave, each image will have more or less
        contrast.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can also use these to represent color in the same way, but let's
        start with black-and-white images for now. To represent colorless
        images, we need some horizontal wave images,
      </p>
      <p>
        <img
          id="img-y-component"
          src="img/components-4-0.png"
          class="sketch sketch-small"
        />
      </p>
      <p>Along with some vertical wave images.</p>
      <p>
        <img
          id="img-x-component"
          src="img/components-0-4.png"
          class="sketch sketch-small"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        By themselves, just horizontal and vertical images aren't enough to
        represent the types of images we get. We also need some extra ones that
        you get by multiplying the two together.
