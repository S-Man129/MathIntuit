    <h1>Conic Sections</h1>
    <p>
      Conic sections are the curves obtained by intersecting a plane with a
      double-napped cone. The angle of the plane relative to the cone determines
      the shape of the intersection. The primary types of conic sections are
      circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas.
    </p>

    <h2>Types of Conic Sections</h2>

    <h3>Circle</h3>
    <p>
      A circle is formed when the plane is perpendicular to the axis of the
      cone.
    </p>
    <div class="formula">\( (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 \)</div>
    <p>Here, \((h, k)\) is the center, and \(r\) is the radius.</p>

    <h3>Ellipse</h3>
    <p>
      An ellipse is formed when the plane is angled such that it intersects both
      nappes of the cone but does not pass through the apex.
    </p>
    <div class="formula">
      \( \frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} + \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1 \)
    </div>
    <p>
      Here, \((h, k)\) is the center, \(a\) is the semi-major axis, and \(b\) is
      the semi-minor axis.
    </p>

    <h3>Parabola</h3>
    <p>
      A parabola is formed when the plane is parallel to a generator of the
      cone.
    </p>
    <div class="formula">\( y - k = a(x - h)^2 \)</div>
    <p>
      Here, \((h, k)\) is the vertex, and \(a\) is a constant that determines
      the width of the parabola.
    </p>

    <h3>Hyperbola</h3>
    <p>
      A hyperbola is formed when the plane intersects both nappes of the cone in
      such a way that the angle is steeper than the angle of the cone.
    </p>
    <div class="formula">
      \( \frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1 \)
    </div>
    <p>
      Here, \((h, k)\) is the center, \(a\) is the distance between the vertices
      and the center along the transverse axis, and \(b\) is the distance
      between the vertices and the center along the conjugate axis.
    </p>

    <h2>Applications of Conic Sections</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Orbits of Planets</strong>: Ellipses describe the orbits of
        planets and satellites.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Reflective Properties</strong>: Parabolas are used in the design
        of telescopes and satellite dishes due to their reflective properties.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Architecture and Engineering</strong>: Hyperbolas are used in
        structures like cooling towers and suspension bridges for their
        structural properties.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>
      Find the equation of a parabola with vertex at \((1, 2)\) and focus at
      \((1, 5)\).
    </p>
    <p>
      The distance from the vertex to the focus is \( |k - k'| = 3 \). The
      parabola opens upwards because the focus is above the vertex. The standard
      form of the equation is:
    </p>
    <div class="formula">\( (x - h)^2 = 4p(y - k) \)</div>
    <p>Here, \( (h, k) = (1, 2) \) and \( 4p = 12 \) (since \( p = 3 \)).</p>
    <p>So, the equation is:</p>
    <div class="formula">\( (x - 1)^2 = 12(y - 2) \)</div>
