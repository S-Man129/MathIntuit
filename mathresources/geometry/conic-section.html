    <h1>Conic Sections</h1>
    <p>
      Conic sections are the curves obtained by intersecting a plane with a
      double-napped cone. Depending on the angle of the intersecting plane
      relative to the cone, the intersection produces different shapes: circles,
      ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas. These curves have significant
      importance in mathematics, physics, engineering, and various fields of
      science due to their unique properties and applications.
    </p>

    <h2>Understanding Conic Sections</h2>

    <p>
      Imagine a double-napped cone—a cone with two parts, one extending upwards
      and one downwards. When a plane intersects this cone at various angles and
      positions, it creates different types of curves, known as conic sections:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Circle</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Formed when the plane cuts the cone perpendicular to its axis.
          </li>
          <li>
            All points on a circle are equidistant from a single point called
            the center.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Equation</strong>: \( (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 \), where
            \((h, k)\) is the center, and \(r\) is the radius.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Ellipse</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Formed when the plane intersects the cone at an angle, but does not
            pass through the base of the cone.
          </li>
          <li>
            An ellipse looks like a stretched circle, with two focal points. The
            sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci
            is constant.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Equation</strong>: \( \frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} + \frac{(y -
            k)^2}{b^2} = 1 \), where \((h, k)\) is the center, \(a\) is the
            semi-major axis, and \(b\) is the semi-minor axis.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Parabola</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>Formed when the plane is parallel to a generator of the cone.</li>
          <li>
            A parabola has a single focus and a directrix. The distance from any
            point on the parabola to the focus is equal to the distance from
            that point to the directrix.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Equation</strong>: \( y - k = a(x - h)^2 \) or \( x - h =
            a(y - k)^2 \), where \((h, k)\) is the vertex, and \(a\) is a
            constant that determines the parabola's width.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Hyperbola</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Formed when the plane intersects both nappes of the cone at an angle
            steeper than the side of the cone.
          </li>
          <li>
            A hyperbola consists of two separate curves (branches). The
            difference in distances from any point on the hyperbola to the two
            foci is constant.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Equation</strong>: \( \frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y -
            k)^2}{b^2} = 1 \), where \((h, k)\) is the center, \(a\) is the
            distance between the vertices and the center along the transverse
            axis, and \(b\) is the distance from the center to the vertices
            along the conjugate axis.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

        <strong>Properties</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Ellipses have two axes: the major axis (longest diameter) and the
            minor axis (shortest diameter).
          </li>
          <li>
            The sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the two
            foci is constant.
          </li>

          <li>
            Elliptical orbits are common in astronomy. For instance, planets
            orbit the sun in an elliptical path with the sun at one focus.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ellipses are also used in architecture and engineering, such as in
            the design of whispering galleries and elliptical archways.
          </li>

    <h3>3. Parabola</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Properties</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>
            The parabola has a single axis of symmetry and a vertex where the
            curve is most sharply curved.
          </li>
          <li>
            The focus lies along the axis of symmetry, and the directrix is a
            line perpendicular to this axis.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Applications</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Parabolas are widely used in physics and engineering. The path of a
            projectile under uniform gravity is parabolic.
          </li>
          <li>
            Parabolic reflectors are used in satellite dishes, car headlights,
            and telescopes to focus light and radio waves.
          </li>
          <li>
            In agriculture, parabolic irrigation systems are designed to
            distribute water evenly over large areas.

    <h3>4. Hyperbola</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Properties</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>
            A hyperbola consists of two branches, each of which is a mirror
            image of the other.
          </li>
          <li>
            The asymptotes of a hyperbola are straight lines that the curve
            approaches but never touches.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Applications</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>
            In navigation and communication, hyperbolas are used in systems like
            GPS to determine positions based on the difference in distances from
            two fixed points.
          </li>
          <li>
            In physics, hyperbolic trajectories describe the paths of objects
            under certain forces, such as the trajectory of a spacecraft
            escaping a planet’s gravity.
          </li>
          <li>
            In economics, hyperbolas are used in cost and efficiency analysis,
            particularly in the study of economies of scale.

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Navigation</strong>:

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Art and Design</strong>:
        <p>
          Artists and designers frequently use conic sections to create balanced
          and harmonious compositions, as these shapes naturally appeal to the
          human eye.

    <p>
      Conic sections are fundamental shapes in mathematics with rich geometric
      properties and diverse applications across various fields. From the simple
