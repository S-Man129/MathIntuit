    <h1>Bessel Functions</h1>
    <p>
      Bessel functions are a family of solutions to Bessel's differential
      equation, which appears in a wide range of physical problems, particularly
      those involving cylindrical or spherical symmetry. Named after the German
      mathematician Friedrich Bessel, these functions play a crucial role in
      fields such as physics, engineering, and applied mathematics. Bessel
      functions describe wave propagation, heat conduction, and vibrations in
      cylindrical objects, making them indispensable in the study of phenomena
      like electromagnetic waves, fluid dynamics, and mechanical vibrations.
    </p>

    <h2>Bessel's Differential Equation</h2>
    <p>
      Bessel's differential equation is a second-order linear differential
      equation of the form:
    </p>
    <div class="formula">
      \[ x^2 \frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + x \frac{dy}{dx} + (x^2 - n^2)y = 0 \]
    </div>
    <p>Here:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>\( x \) is the independent variable.</li>
      <li>\( y(x) \) is the function to be determined.</li>
      <li>\( n \) is a constant, known as the order of the Bessel function.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The solutions to this equation are called Bessel functions. There are two
      main types of Bessel functions: Bessel functions of the first kind (\(
      J_n(x) \)) and Bessel functions of the second kind (\( Y_n(x) \)).
    </p>

    <h2>Bessel Functions of the First Kind: \( J_n(x) \)</h2>
    <p>
      Bessel functions of the first kind, denoted by \( J_n(x) \), are the most
      commonly used Bessel functions. They are particularly important when
      dealing with boundary conditions that are finite at the origin (i.e., when
      \( x = 0 \)).
    </p>

    <h3>Series Representation:</h3>
    <p>
      The Bessel function of the first kind of order \( n \) can be represented
      by an infinite series:
    </p>
    <div class="formula">
      \[ J_n(x) = \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^m}{m! \, \Gamma(m+n+1)}
      \left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^{2m+n} \]
    </div>
    <p>
      Where \( \Gamma(z) \) is the gamma function, which generalizes the
      factorial function.
    </p>

    <h3>Properties:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Orthogonality:</strong> Bessel functions of different orders are
        orthogonal over certain intervals, which makes them useful in solving
        problems with cylindrical symmetry.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Oscillatory Nature:</strong> For large values of \( x \), \(
        J_n(x) \) behaves like a damped oscillatory function, similar to a sine
        or cosine wave, but with an amplitude that decreases as \( x \)
        increases.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <p>
      Consider the vibration of a circular drum membrane. The displacement of
      the membrane can be described by a Bessel function of the first kind. The
      function \( J_0(x) \), where \( x \) is proportional to the radial
      distance from the center of the drum, describes the shape of the membrane
      as it vibrates.
    </p>

    <h2>Bessel Functions of the Second Kind: \( Y_n(x) \)</h2>
    <p>
      Bessel functions of the second kind, denoted by \( Y_n(x) \), are also
      solutions to Bessel's differential equation. Unlike \( J_n(x) \), these
      functions are singular at the origin (i.e., they tend to infinity as \( x
      \) approaches zero).
    </p>

    <h3>Series Representation:</h3>
    <p>
      The Bessel function of the second kind of order \( n \) can be represented
      as:
    </p>
    <div class="formula">
      \[ Y_n(x) = \frac{J_n(x) \cos(n\pi) - J_{-n}(x)}{\sin(n\pi)} \]
    </div>
    <p>
      For non-integer \( n \), this expression simplifies, but for integer
      orders, \( Y_n(x) \) can also be defined using a logarithmic term in
      addition to the series.
    </p>

    <h3>Properties:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Singularity at the Origin:</strong> \( Y_n(x) \) tends to
        infinity as \( x \) approaches zero, making it useful in problems where
        a singular behavior at the origin is required.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Oscillatory Behavior:</strong> Like \( J_n(x) \), \( Y_n(x) \)
        also exhibits oscillatory behavior for large \( x \), but with a
        different phase shift.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <p>
      In problems involving wave propagation in cylindrical coordinates,
      particularly when dealing with standing waves in a hollow cylinder, \(
      Y_n(x) \) often appears as part of the general solution, particularly when
      the boundary condition involves a singularity at the origin.
    </p>

    <h4>Graphical Representation:</h4>
    <p>
      Bessel functions of the first kind or second kind for both positive (blue)
      and negative (red) real order n:
    </p>
    <div class="box-container text-center mb-4">
      <div id="mathcell" class="mathcell box">
        <script src="./js/besselFunction.js"></script>
      </div>
      <p>Visualizing Bessel Function of the First Kind and Second Kind</p>
    </div>
    <p>
      This allows one to see explicitly that the two functions are linearly
      dependent for integer order, either coinciding for even order or being
      mirror images for odd order. It also allows one to see the relative
      location of the zeros of the two functions.
    </p>

    <h2>Modified Bessel Functions</h2>
    <p>
      In addition to the standard Bessel functions, there are also modified
      Bessel functions of the first kind (\( I_n(x) \)) and second kind (\(
      K_n(x) \)). These functions are solutions to the modified Bessel equation:
    </p>
    <div class="formula">
      \[ x^2 \frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + x \frac{dy}{dx} - (x^2 + n^2)y = 0 \]
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong
          >Modified Bessel Function of the First Kind: \( I_n(x) \):</strong
        >
        This function is used in problems with exponential growth, such as
        diffusion processes in cylindrical geometries. Unlike \( J_n(x) \), \(
        I_n(x) \) grows exponentially as \( x \) increases.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >Modified Bessel Function of the Second Kind: \( K_n(x) \):</strong
        >
        This function tends to zero exponentially as \( x \) increases and is
        used in problems where the solution must decay at infinity.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Applications of Bessel Functions</h2>
    <p>
      Bessel functions appear in a wide variety of physical and engineering
      contexts:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Electromagnetic Waves:</strong>
        <p>
          Bessel functions describe the radial component of the electromagnetic
          field in cylindrical waveguides and optical fibers, where the symmetry
          of the problem requires a solution to Bessel's differential equation.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Heat Conduction:</strong>
        <p>
          In problems involving heat conduction in cylindrical objects (such as
          a long, thin rod), the temperature distribution is governed by Bessel
          functions.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Vibrations:</strong>
        <p>
          The study of vibrations in circular membranes (such as drumheads) uses
          Bessel functions to describe the modes of vibration. The zeros of \(
          J_n(x) \) correspond to the resonance frequencies of the membrane.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Quantum Mechanics:</strong>
        <p>
          Bessel functions are used in solving the Schr√∂dinger equation for
          particles in cylindrical or spherical potentials, such as the hydrogen
          atom or cylindrical quantum dots.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Acoustics:</strong>
        <p>
          Bessel functions are used to model sound waves in cylindrical
          structures, such as in the design of loudspeakers and acoustic
          waveguides.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Visualization and Interpretation</h2>
    <p>
      Visualizing Bessel functions can provide insight into their behavior. The
      function \( J_0(x) \) starts at 1 when \( x = 0 \) and oscillates with
      decreasing amplitude as \( x \) increases. The functions \( J_1(x) \) and
      higher orders start at zero and also exhibit oscillatory behavior, but
      with a phase shift relative to \( J_0(x) \).
    </p>
    <p>
      The zeros of Bessel functions are particularly important in applications.
      For instance, the points where \( J_0(x) \) crosses zero correspond to the
      nodal lines in the vibration of a circular membrane.
    </p>

    <h2>Historical Context</h2>
    <p>
      Bessel functions were first introduced by Friedrich Bessel in the early
      19th century during his study of planetary motion. Since then, they have
      been extensively studied and applied in various scientific fields. Their
      properties, including their series representations, orthogonality, and
      relationship to other special functions, have been thoroughly explored,
      making them a key part of the mathematical toolkit for solving
      differential equations with cylindrical or spherical symmetry.
    </p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Bessel functions are an essential class of special functions that arise in
      the solutions to Bessel's differential equation. Whether dealing with wave
      propagation, heat conduction, vibrations, or quantum mechanics, Bessel
      functions provide the mathematical framework needed to solve problems with
      cylindrical or spherical symmetry. Their oscillatory nature,
      orthogonality, and the presence of zeros make them invaluable in both
      theoretical and applied mathematics, as well as in engineering and the
      physical sciences.
